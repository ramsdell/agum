-- Integer Solutions of Linear Inhomogeneous Equations
--
-- A linear equation with integer coefficients is represented as a
-- pair of lists of non-zero integers, the coefficients and the
-- constants.  If there are no constants, the linear equation
-- represented by (c, []) is the homogeneous equation:
--
-- >     c[0]*x[0] + c[1]*x[1] + ... + c[n-1]*x[n-1] = 0
--
-- where n is the length of c.  Otherwise, (c, d) represents the
-- inhomogeneous equation:
--
-- >     c[0]*x[0] + c[1]*x[1] + ... + c[n-1]*x[n-1] = g
--
-- where g = gcd(d[0], d[1], ..., d[m-1]), and m is the length of d.
-- Thus g is the greatest common denominator of the elements of d.
--
-- A solution is a partial map from variables to terms, and a term is
-- a pair of lists of integers, the variable part of the term followed
-- by the constant part.  The variable part may specify variables not
-- in the input.  In other words, the length of the coefficents in the
-- answer may exceed the length of the coefficients in the input.  For
-- example, the solution of
--
-- >     64x - 41y = 1
--
-- is x = -41z - 16 and y = -64z - 25.  The computed solution is read
-- off the list returned as an answer.
--
-- >     intLinEq [64,-41] [1] =
-- >         [(0,([0,0,0,0,0,0,-41],[-16])),
-- >         (1,([0,0,0,0,0,0,-64],[-25]))]
--
-- The algorithm used to find solutions is described in Vol. 2 of The
-- Art of Computer Programming \/ Seminumerical Alorithms, 2nd Ed.,
-- 1981, by Donald E. Knuth, pg. 327.  To show sums, we write
--
-- >     sum[i] c[i]*x[i] for c[0]*x[0] + c[1]*x[1] + ... + c[n-1]*x[n-1].
--
-- The algorithm's initial values are the linear equation (c,d) and an
-- empty substitution s.
--
-- 1.  Let c[i] be the smallest non-zero coefficient in absolute value.
--
-- 2.  If c[i] < 0, multiply c and d by -1 and goto step 1.
--
-- 3.  If c[i] = 1, a general solution of the following form has been
-- found:
--
-- >     x[i] = sum[j] -c'[j]*x[j] + d[k] for all k
--
--  where c' is c with c'[i] = 0.  Use the equation to eliminate x[i]
--  from the range of the current substitution s.  If variable x[i] is
--  in the original equation, add the mapping to substitution s.
--
-- 4.  If c[i] divides every coefficient in c,
--
--     * if c[i] divides every constant in d, divide c and d by c[i]
--       and goto step 3,
--
--     * otherwise fail because there is no solution.
--
-- 5.  Otherwise, eliminate x[i] as above in favor of freshly created
-- variable x[n], where n is the length of c.
--
-- >    x[n] = sum[j] (c[j] div c[i] * x[j])
--
-- Goto step 1 and solve the equation:
--
-- >    c[i]*x[n] + sum[j] (c[j] mod c[i])*x[j] = d[k] for all k
